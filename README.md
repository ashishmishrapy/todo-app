# My TODO App

This is a simple and clean **Todo List App** built using vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Even after learning React, I made this app to **brush up and practice my core JavaScript fundamentals**.

## Features

- Add new todos
- Edit existing todos
- Mark todos as done (with strikethrough)
- Delete todos
- Responsive and clean UI

## Why I Built This

Although I've been working with React lately, I believe it's important to stay sharp with the basics. So I challenged myself to build this Todo app without any frameworks â€” just pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
